# Fast Flight (Java Application)
Welcome to Fast Flight! This Java application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find and demonstrate the shortest path between countries on an interactive map using JavaFX and Gluon Maps.

Built on the Gluon starter template, this application uses OpenStreetMap tiles in JavaFX. You can find it here: [Gluon Starter](https://start.gluon.io).


### Run the project on JVM/HotSpot:

- `mvn gluonfx:run`
- or manually from Maven >> Plugins >> gluonfx:run


## Key Features for Users
- Finds and displays the shortest path between selected countries.
- Enhances user experience with smooth animation and simple abstract UI.
- Displays shortest path information: Distance and the path taken between the selected countries.
- Displays a map containing the entire flight path from source to destination countries.

## For Developers

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
    - Efficiently calculates the shortest path in a weighted graph.
    - Visualization of the algorithm's output step-by-step on the map.

- **JavaFX and Gluon Maps Integration**:
    - Uses JavaFX for the user interface and interactive elements.
